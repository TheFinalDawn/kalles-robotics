# Contributions
Oh boy, time to structure how people are supposed to contribute because I'll bet somebody here doesn't know GitHub!  
*I know for a fact the teacher doesn't.*  
Anyway. Have a table of contents! :boom:

## GitHub Basics
I'm adding this here since I'm pretty sure at least **someone** doesn't know GitHub. I'll put it in a list.  
* The Code tab (the one you're on) contains the programming already being used.  
* The Issues tab is where you report bugs, request features, add stuff to a [todo list,](https://github.com/TheFinalDawn/kalles-robotics/labels/To%20Do) etc.  
* The Pull Requests tab is where it gets interesting. This tab is where you send your contributions! I'll explain this one later.  
* The Projects tab. This tab is mainly for organization, and you can see who has been assigned to what.  
* Almost done, we have the Wiki tab. That one... Isn't used much... ~~at least in our case~~  
* Now for some admin tabs! The Insights tab is where admins can see repository stats.  
* Last, but not least ~~(yet still an admin tool)~~ is the settings tab. Of course.  
  
## Contribution Rules
Okay, now for the good part.  
#### To make sure everyone's being nice, programmers are ***REQUIRED*** to post ALL updates (commits) to their own branch, labeled (your username/real.name)-update, unless you're in a Teletype Portal.
#### The person posting the updates must add everyone else as contributors to the commit.
#### When posting a pull request to send your updates (try doing it at the end of each meet, at least), please label it based on what it's about. For example, if [@TheFinalDawn](https://github.com/TheFinalDawn) were to fix a turning bug that caused the robot to turn forever, he would label the pull request "Fix infinite turning bug" and add the [bug](https://github.com/TheFinalDawn/kalles-robotics/labels/bug) label to the request.
#### Please contact your head programmer for help with GitHub-related issues.
